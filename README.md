# awesome-find

A beautiful, powerful, and efficient Chrome extension for searching text on a page.

> This extension is inspired by the Chrome extension [findwhatever](https://github.com/ImSwordTooth/findwhatever). I used it daily but found its features, UI, and implementation didn't match my preferences, so I created **awesome-find**. If you want a lightweight, high-performance search tool, try **awesome-find**. If you need to search across all iframes and observe DOM mutations, **findwhatever** may be a better fit.

## Features

- Case-sensitive, whole-word, and regular-expression (regex) search modes.
- Search history with hover preview and quick research.
- Pin frequently used searches for quick access.
- Copy matched text directly in regex mode.
